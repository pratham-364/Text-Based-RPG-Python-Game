## MADE BY PRATHAM GUPTA
It's my first python Project. It's a RPG game which is based on python3. Have fun playing it.

My first Python based RPG battle text-game

Also tell me what to improve

Totally based on the use of classes, dictionary, for/ if/ else/ while loops and at start a time function

main file consists of how the game proceeds

game, inventory and magic files consists classes to be used in the main file

#### To play open main file from the battle folder and run the project

Have fun :)
